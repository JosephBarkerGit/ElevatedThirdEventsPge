To the Development team at elevated Third:

I want to thank you for the opportunity to work on this code challenge. I thouroughly enjoyed it! If you need access to sign in as an
administrator to my website, I have created a username of ElevatedThirdAdmin and a password of ElevatedThird1. I didn't have as much time as
I would have liked to work on the grid-format view as I would have liked, but hopefuly this project gives you a glimpse of my capibilities.

If you have any issues with my project or are having trouble getting it up and running, please feel free to contact me anytime at 
jbarker@millikin.edu.

Thank you for this opportunity,
Joseph Barker
